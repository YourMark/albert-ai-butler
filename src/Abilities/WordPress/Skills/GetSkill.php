/**
 * Get Skill ability class.
 *
 * Skills have been registered as MCP prompts since 1.2.0, and in practice that
 * made them unreachable: prompts surface in clients as user-triggered slash
 * commands, and a model working on its own never pulls one. A 301-line playbook
 * that is never read is a silent failure, not a theoretical one, this ability
 * is what turns the skills channel into something autonomous work can actually
 * use. Prompt registration stays alongside it for clients that do expose
 * prompts.
 *
 * Read-only, and gated on `edit_posts`: a skill is written guidance about how to
 * work on this site, so the people who may read it are the people who may work
 * on it.
